# Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
What is an eigenvector? What is an eigenvalue? What is the relationship between the two?

# Principal components 
TV & Movies only contain 2D information but most of the information is still preserved and the depth information does not add too much value. Thus, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data by projecting it onto a 2D plane.

# Auto-correlation coefficient (ACF) - TODO: check and understand 
The ACF is a measure of the correlation between the data and a lagged version of itself. It is used to find the optimal number of lags to use in a time series model.
