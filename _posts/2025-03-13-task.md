Let's explore various aspects of C# programming through different code examples.

## 1. Parallel Processing with Task Parallel Library (TPL)

The first example demonstrates parallel processing using TPL:

```csharp
ParallelOptions options = new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 10 };
Parallel.For(0, 10, options, i =>
{
    // Parallel processing code here
});

// Resource-intensive computation
static void ResourceIntensiveFunction()
{
    double result = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++)
    {
        result += Math.Sqrt(i);
    }
}
```

This code shows how to limit parallel processing to 10 threads and measure performance using `Stopwatch`.

## 2. Delegates in C#

Here's an example of using delegates for method invocation:

```csharp
public delegate int Operation(int a, int b);

public static int Add(int a, int b) => a + b;
public static int Multiply(int a, int b) => a * b;

public static void PerformOperation(int a, int b, Operation operation)
{
    int result = operation(a, b);
    Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result);
}
```

Delegates provide a way to pass methods as parameters, enabling flexible and reusable code.

## 3. Unicode Output in Console

Console applications can display Unicode characters:

```csharp
Console.OutputEncoding = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode;
Console.WriteLine("\u2304");        // âŒ„
Console.WriteLine("\U0001F4AF");    // ðŸ’¯
Console.WriteLine("\U0001F604");    // ðŸ˜„
```

Setting proper encoding ensures correct display of Unicode characters.

## 4. Asynchronous Matrix Operations

This example shows parallel matrix computations:

```csharp
static async Task Main()
{
    const int N = 10000;
    Task[] tasks = new Task[4];
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    {
        tasks[i] = Task.Run(() => ComputeMatrixInverse(N));
    }
    await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
}
```

The code demonstrates parallel matrix operations using Tasks for improved performance.

## 5. Task and Thread Management

Here's an example of task and thread management:

```csharp
Task singleTask = Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Single task on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    Thread.Sleep(2000);
});

Parallel.For(0, 4, i => {
    Console.WriteLine($"Parallel {i} on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    Thread.Sleep(2000);
});
```

This demonstrates different ways to handle concurrent operations in C#.

## 6. Timer Implementation

Finally, a timer example:

```csharp
private static System.Timers.Timer aTimer;

private static void SetTimer()
{
    aTimer = new System.Timers.Timer(2000);
    aTimer.Elapsed += OnTimedEvent;
    aTimer.AutoReset = true;
    aTimer.Enabled = true;
}
```

This shows how to implement recurring events using Timer in C#.

Each of these examples demonstrates different aspects of C# programming, from basic concepts to advanced parallel processing techniques. The code samples provide practical implementations that can be used as building blocks for larger applications.


# `volatile` Keyword 
## Why `volatile` is Useful

In multi-threaded applications, threads may cache variables in their local memory, leading to inconsistencies when the variable is updated by another thread. The `volatile` keyword prevents such caching, ensuring that the variable is always read from the main memory, thus maintaining data consistency across threads.

## How `volatile` is Used

To use the `volatile` keyword, simply declare the field with the `volatile` modifier. For example:

```csharp
private volatile bool keepRunning = true;
```

In the provided code, `keepRunning` is marked as `volatile` to ensure that changes made by one thread (e.g., the `Stop` method) are immediately visible to other threads (e.g., the `Worker` method).

## When to Use `volatile`

- When a field is accessed by multiple threads without using locks.
- When you need to ensure that the most recent value of a field is always read by all threads.

## When Not to Use `volatile`

- When more complex synchronization is required (e.g., atomic operations, multiple fields).
- When you need to perform compound operations (e.g., incrementing a counter) that must be atomic.
- When the field is not accessed by multiple threads.

In such cases, other synchronization mechanisms like `lock`, `Monitor`, or `Interlocked` should be used to ensure thread safety.

```csharp

using System;
using System.Threading;

public class VolatileExample
{
    private volatile bool keepRunning = true;

    public void Start()
    {
        Thread workerThread = new Thread(Worker);
        workerThread.Start();
    }

    private void Worker()
    {
        while (keepRunning)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Working...");
            Thread.Sleep(1000); // Simulate work
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Stopped working.");
    }

    public void Stop()
    {
        keepRunning = false;
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
        VolatileExample example = new VolatileExample();
        example.Start();

        // Simulate some work, then stop the worker thread
        Thread.Sleep(5000); // Let it run for 5 seconds
        example.Stop();
    }
}

```

# Time Measurement in C#

Time is a critical aspect of many applications. C# provides several ways to measure, track, and represent time. Let's explore the most common approaches:

## DateTime

DateTime represents a specific point in time, typically expressed as a date and time of day.

```csharp
// Get current date and time
DateTime now = DateTime.Now; // Local time
DateTime utcNow = DateTime.UtcNow; // UTC time

// Creating specific dates
DateTime specificDate = new DateTime(2023, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59);

// Parsing from string
DateTime parsedDate = DateTime.Parse("2023-01-01 12:30:45");

// Formatting
string formatted = now.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss");

// Date calculations
DateTime tomorrow = now.AddDays(1);
DateTime nextMonth = now.AddMonths(1);
TimeSpan difference = tomorrow - now;
```

## TimeSpan

TimeSpan represents a time interval (duration).

```csharp
// Create from explicit values
TimeSpan duration = new TimeSpan(2, 30, 45); // 2 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds
TimeSpan twoHours = TimeSpan.FromHours(2);
TimeSpan tenMinutes = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);

// Create from difference between DateTimes
DateTime start = DateTime.Now;
DateTime end = start.AddHours(3);
TimeSpan elapsed = end - start;

// Properties
double totalHours = elapsed.TotalHours;
int minutes = elapsed.Minutes; // Just the minutes component (0-59)
```

## Stopwatch

Stopwatch provides high-precision timing for measuring code execution performance.

```csharp
using System.Diagnostics;

// Basic usage
Stopwatch sw = new Stopwatch();
sw.Start();
// Code to measure
DoSomethingExpensive();
sw.Stop();

Console.WriteLine($"Execution took {sw.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms");
Console.WriteLine($"Or more precisely: {sw.Elapsed.TotalSeconds} seconds");

// Reusing stopwatch
sw.Reset(); // Resets back to zero
sw.Restart(); // Combines Reset() and Start()
```

## Environment.TickCount

TickCount provides the number of milliseconds since the system started.

```csharp
// Get system uptime in milliseconds (wraps around after ~25 days)
int tickCount = Environment.TickCount;

// Get system uptime in milliseconds (Int64 version, doesn't wrap)
long tickCount64 = Environment.TickCount64;

// Calculate elapsed time between operations
int start = Environment.TickCount;
DoSomeWork();
int end = Environment.TickCount;
int elapsed = end - start;
```

## DateTimeOffset

DateTimeOffset represents a point in time with timezone awareness.

```csharp
// Create with timezone information
DateTimeOffset now = DateTimeOffset.Now;
DateTimeOffset utcNow = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow;

// Create with specific offset
DateTimeOffset custom = new DateTimeOffset(2023, 12, 31, 23, 59, 59, TimeSpan.FromHours(-5));

// Get from DateTime
DateTimeOffset fromDateTime = new DateTimeOffset(DateTime.Now);

// Access timezone information
TimeSpan offset = now.Offset;
```

## ValueStopwatch (High-Performance Option)

For extremely performance-sensitive code, a struct-based stopwatch can reduce allocations:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

// Lightweight stopwatch (struct-based to avoid allocations)
public readonly struct ValueStopwatch
{
    private readonly long _startTimestamp;
    
    public static ValueStopwatch StartNew() => new ValueStopwatch(Stopwatch.GetTimestamp());
    
    private ValueStopwatch(long startTimestamp)
    {
        _startTimestamp = startTimestamp;
    }
    
    public TimeSpan GetElapsedTime()
    {
        long end = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();
        long elapsed = end - _startTimestamp;
        return TimeSpan.FromTicks(elapsed * TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond / Stopwatch.Frequency);
    }
}

// Usage
var watch = ValueStopwatch.StartNew();
DoSomeWork();
TimeSpan elapsed = watch.GetElapsedTime();
```

## Choosing the Right Tool

- **DateTime**: For calendar dates and times
- **DateTimeOffset**: When timezone information matters
- **TimeSpan**: For time intervals and calculations
- **Stopwatch**: For precise code performance measurement
- **Environment.TickCount**: For system uptime or simple elapsed time

Each approach has its strengths and is designed for specific scenarios. For performance-critical applications, Stopwatch is usually the best choice for timing code execution.
